# Game Development Studio #2: Bowling with Physics

**Course**: COSC416A Game Dev with Unity

**Completed by**: Ariana Rice (24816522)

## About this project

This Studio involved following a tutorial to build a simple bowling game. We got a more in-depth look at Unity's physics system, 
as well as how to use Cinemachine Camera, how to import and use assets from external sources, and, more broadly, got an idea of 
how to split up responsibities between different game objects and utilize some simple design patterns. These Studios have been
helpful in getting us started/establishing foundational knowledge, and I look forward to future ones where we have a little more 
freedom/challenge.
